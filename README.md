## What is Github Actions ? 
- GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) tool integrated into GitHub that allows developers to automate workflows for building, testing, and deploying their code. It uses a YAML-based configuration file to define the sequence of steps (or "actions") that should be executed in response to events like pushes to a repository, pull requests, or scheduled tasks.

## What I have done in this Repo ?
- In this repo, I have used OWASP ZAP security .yml file to test Vulnerable Web application. Whenever a new Push or Pull action is triggered to this repo. The scan will be automatically triggered.
